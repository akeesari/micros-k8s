#  Create your first microservice with .NET Core

## Introduction

Welcome to the first lab in our Microservices chapter. In this lab, we will dive into creating a simple RESTful service using the ASP.NET Core Web API project template.

This lab will demonstrate the process of building a RESTful service and generating a docker container using Dockerfile. By following this example, you will learn the fundamentals of creating RESTful APIs using the ASP.NET Core.

## Technical Scenario

As a `Backend (BE)` developer, you have been tasked with creating a RESTful service using .NET Core Web API, which is one of the services on our microservices list. This lab will serve as your introduction to the Microservices Architecture, starting with the basics of setting up a repository, creating a small project, and ultimately containerizing the microservice you build. The containerized microservice will then be pushed to the Azure Container Registry (ACR).

The primary objective of this lab is to prepare an application for deployment on Kubernetes. The microservices you create in this lab will be utilized in subsequent labs, such as the creation of DevOps pipelines or the deployment to Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS). By completing this lab, you will gain a foundational understanding of how microservices can be developed, containerized, and integrated into a Kubernetes environment.

## Objective

In this exercise, our objective is to accomplish and learn the following tasks:

- **Step-1:** Create a new repo in azure DevOps
- **Step-2:** Clone the repository
- **Step-3:** Create a new Web API project
- **Step-4:** Test Web API project
- **Step-5:** Add Dockerfiles to the project
- **Step-6:** Build & Test docker container locally
- **Step-7:** Publish docker container to ACR

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- An Organization in Azure DevOps
- A Project in Azure DevOps
- Create Repository permission
- Git client tool
- Download and install software for .NET development 
- Docker and the VS Code Docker extension
- Azure Container Registry (ACR)
 
## Architecture Diagram

## Step-1: Create a new repo in azure DevOps

We will create a new repository in Azure DevOps to store our project code and related files.

To create a new repository in Azure DevOps, follow these steps:

1. Login into azure DevOps -  [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com){:target="_blank"}
2. Select the project where we want to create the repo
3. Click on `Repos` left nav link
4. From the repo drop-down, select `New repository`
5. In the `Create a new repository` dialog, verify that Git is the repository type and enter a name for the new repository. 
6. You can also add a README and create a `.gitignore` for the type of code you plan to manage in the repo.
7. I'd prefer to use lower case for all repos (one of the best practice)
    - Repo name - `aspnetapi` 

!!! Best-Practice
    When creating repositories in Azure DevOps, it is recommended to use lower case for all repository names. Using lower case consistently throughout your repositories helps maintain consistency, readability, and ease of navigation within your projects.

    By adhering to this best practice, you ensure that your repository names are uniform and standardized, regardless of the specific domain or microservice they represent. This practice promotes clarity and reduces the chances of confusion or inconsistencies when working with multiple repositories within your organization.

For example: 

![image.jpg](images/image-11.jpg)

## Step-2: Clone the repo from azure DevOps

After creating the repository, we will clone it locally to establish a local working copy of the project.

To clone a repository from Azure DevOps, you will need to have the Git client installed on your local machine. follow these steps to clone the source code locally:

1. Sign in to the Azure DevOps website [Azure DevOps Login](https://dev.azure.com/){:target="_blank"} with your Azure DevOps account.

2. Navigate to the project that contains the repository you want to clone.

3. Click on the `Repos` tab in the navigation menu.

4. Find the repository you want to clone and click on the `Clone` button.

5. Copy the URL of the repository.

6. Open a terminal window or command prompt on your local machine, and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

7. Run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository URL>
```

When prompted, enter your Azure DevOps credentials.

The repository will be cloned to your local machine, and you can start working with the code.

Examples:

```bash
C:\Users\anji.keesari>cd C:\Source\Repos
C:\Source\Repos>git clone https://keesari.visualstudio.com/Microservices/_git/aspnetapi

or

# cloning from main branch for the first time
git clone git clone https://keesari.visualstudio.com/Microservices/_git/aspnetapi  -b main C:\Source\Repos\Microservices\aspnetapi

# cloning from feature branches
git clone https://keesari.visualstudio.com/Microservices/_git/aspnetapi  -b develop C:\Source\Repos\Microservices\aspnetapi

```

Please refer to our [Git Cheat-Sheet](https://anjikeesari.com/developertools/cheatsheets/git-cheat-sheet/){:target="_blank"}, which provides a comprehensive list of Git commands and their usage. 

[Anji Keesari - Git Commands](https://anjikeesari.com/developertools/cheatsheets/git-cheat-sheet){:target="_blank"}

## Step-3: Create a new .NET Core Web API project

Using the .NET Core Web API template, we will create a new project that serves as the foundation for our RESTful service.

We will be using Visual Studio Code instead of Visual Studio to make things faster and easy and save time and money.

!!! Best-Practice
    To optimize efficiency, save time, and reduce costs, I recommend using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as your preferred development environment instead of Visual Studio.

    Visual Studio Code is a lightweight, cross-platform code editor that offers powerful features and extensions tailored for modern development workflows. It provides a streamlined and customizable interface, allowing you to focus on coding without unnecessary overhead.


To create a new .NET Core Web API project, you will need to have the .NET Core SDK installed on your machine. You can download the .NET Core SDK from the .NET website [Download .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download){:target="_blank"}.

Once you have the .NET Core SDK installed, follow these steps to create a new .NET Core Web API project:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
2. Run the `dotnet new` command to create a new .NET Core Web API project:
Let's take a look some useful `dotnet` command before creating the project.
Use this command to get the `dotnet` commands help so that your get idea on how use these commands better. 
```bash
dotnet --help
```
Use this command to get list of available `dotnet` project templates
```bash
dotnet new --list

# output

These templates matched your input: 

Template Name                                 Short Name           Language    Tags

.
and more....
```
Use this command to actually create new project
```sh
dotnet new webapi -o aspnetapi

or 
dotnet new webapi -o aspnetapi --no-https -f net7.0

cd aspnetapi

code . 

or 
code -r ../aspnetapi
```
Additional Notes:
```bash
  `-o` parameter creates a directory
  `--no-https` flag creates an app that will run without an HTTPS certificate
  `-f` parameter indicates creation

# Output

C:\WINDOWS\system32>cd C:\Source\Repos

C:\Source\Repos>dotnet new webapi -o aspnetapi
The template "ASP.NET Core Web API" was created successfully.

```
3. Here is the example of adding packages to .net projects.
```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory
```
4. Run the following command to restore the project's dependencies:
```bash
dotnet restore
```

!!! Mac User
    If you're on a Mac with an Apple M1 chip, you need to install the Arm64 version of the SDK before following above commands.

[Download .NET 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0){:target="_blank"}.

Check the install typing by running following in terminal

```bash
dotnet
```

You should see an output similar to the following if the installation is successful

```bash
anjikeesari@Anjis-MacBook-Pro-2 MyMicroservice % dotnet

Usage: dotnet [options]
Usage: dotnet [path-to-application]

Options:
  -h|--help         Display help.
  --info            Display .NET information.
  --list-sdks       Display the installed SDKs.
  --list-runtimes   Display the installed runtimes.

path-to-application:
  The path to an application .dll file to execute.
```


## Step-4: Test the new .NET core Web API project

1.  Run the following command to build the project:
 `dotnet build` command will look for the project or solution file in the current directory and compile the code in it. It will also restore any dependencies required by the project and create the output files in the bin directory.
```bash
dotnet build

# output

Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 17.0.1+b177f8fa7 for .NET
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

  Determining projects to restore...
  All projects are up-to-date for restore.
  AspNetApi -> C:\Source\Repos\AspNetApi\aspnet-api\bin\Debug\net6.0\AspNetApi.dll

Build succeeded.
    0 Warning(s)
    0 Error(s)

Time Elapsed 00:00:01.51
```
2.  Run the following command to start the development server:
 `dotnet run` command will look for the project or solution file in the current directory and compile the code in it. After compiling, it will run the application and any output will be displayed in the console.
```bash
dotnet run

# output

Building...
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: https://localhost:7136
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: http://localhost:5136
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Hosting environment: Development
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Content root path: C:\Source\Repos\AspNetApi\aspnet-api\
```
You will notice the URL in the output, copy the URL and paste it in your favorite browser. you will get a `404 error. ` don’t worry. Just type swagger at the end of the URL and press enter and you will get the following webpage.

![image.jpg](images/image-1.jpg)

- <https://localhost:7136>

- <https://localhost:7136/swagger/index.html> - Swagger URL

- <https://localhost:7136/api/aspnetapi/v1/weatherforecast> - API endpoint URL

If you are able to see this swagger URL in your browser then everything is created and setup as expected.

![image.jpg](images/image-2.jpg)

Use the following command to stop the application in VS Code
```bash
ctrl + c
```
It is time to push your basic project template source into Azure DevOps Git repo.

!!! Best-Practice
    To maintain good version control and ensure a reliable development process, it is strongly recommended to commit and push source code changes to your Git repository before proceeding to the next step.

Use these git commands to push the source code.

```bash
git add .
git commit -am "My fist commit - Create Web API project"
git push
```

## Step-5: Add Dockerfiles to the API project

Dockerfiles will be added to the project, which provide instructions for building a container image of our Web API application.

There are multiple way to create `Dockerfile` depending on your code editor. 
Here are the step-by-step instructions for creating a `Dockerfile` in a .NET Core Web API project:

1. First, open your .NET Core Web API project in Visual Studio code or your favorite code editor.
1. Next, create a new file in the root directory of your project and name it Dockerfile (with no file extension).
1. Open the Dockerfile and add the following code to the file:
``` Dockerfile
#See https://aka.ms/containerfastmode to understand how Visual Studio uses this Dockerfile to build your images for faster debugging.

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["AspNetApi.csproj", "."]
RUN dotnet restore "./AspNetApi.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/."
RUN dotnet build "AspNetApi.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "AspNetApi.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "AspNetApi.dll"]
```
This code defines a Docker image that is based on the aspnet:6.0 image from Microsoft's container registry. The image is divided into four stages:

   - `base:` sets up the working directory and exposes port 80.
   - `build:` restores the project dependencies, builds the project in Release mode, and copies the build output to the /app/build directory.
   - `publish:` publishes the project in Release mode and copies the published output to the /app/publish directory.
   - `final:` sets the working directory to `/app` and copies the published output from the `publish` stage to the current directory. It also specifies the entry point for the container, which is the `dotnet` command with the name of your project's DLL file.


## Step-6: Docker Build & Run

We will build the Docker container locally using the Dockerfiles and ensure that the containerized application functions as expected.

`docker build` is a command that allows you to build a Docker image from a Dockerfile. The Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for Docker to build the image, including the base image to use, the files to include, the commands to run, and the ports to expose.

To build and publish a container image for a .NET Core Web API project, you will need to have Docker installed on your machine. You can download Docker from the Docker website [Get Started with Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started){:target="_blank"}

Once you have Docker installed, follow these steps to build and publish a container for your .NET Core Web API project:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the root of the project.
2. Run the `docker build` command to build the Docker image:
```sh
docker build -t sample/aspnet-api:20230226.1 .
```
output
```sh

```
**Verify the new image**

if you open the docker desktop you should be able to see the newly created image there.
![image.jpg](images/image-3.jpg)
3. Run the `docker run` command to start a container based on the image:
```
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 sample/aspnet-api:20230226.1
```
output
```sh
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]  
      Now listening on: http://[::]:80

      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Hosting environment: Production
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Content root path: /app/
```
Wait for the container to start. You should see output in the terminal indicating that the container is listening on port 80.
Open the docker desktop to see the newly created container in the docker desktop app
![image.jpg](images/image-4.jpg)


Open a web browser and navigate to <http://localhost:8080/api/values> (or whatever URL corresponds to your Web API endpoint) to confirm that the Web API is running inside the Docker container.

use these links for testing when you run docker command from vs code

- <http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html>
- <http://localhost:8080/api/aspnetapi/v1/heartbeat/ping>
- <http://localhost:8080/api/aspnetapi/v1/weatherforecast>

![image.jpg](images/image-5.jpg)

!!! Best-Practice
    When working with Docker containers, it is recommended to follow a consistent naming convention to ensure clarity and organization. The following pattern is suggested for naming Docker containers:

```sh
docker build -t projectname/domainname/appname:yyyymmdd.sequence .

example:
docker build -t project1/sample/aspnet-api:20230226 .
```

You've successfully created a Dockerfile and built a Docker image for your .NET Core Web API project. You can now distribute the Docker image to other machines or deploy it to a cloud service like Azure or AWS.


!!! Tip
    If you need to clean up containers and images locally in Docker Desktop, you can use the following commands:

```sh
# To delete all containers including its volumes use,
#     docker rm -vf $(docker ps -aq)

# To delete all the images,
#     docker rmi -f $(docker images -aq)
```

## Step-7: Push docker container to ACR

Finally, we will publish the built Docker container to the Azure Container Registry (ACR), making it accessible for deployment and distribution.

Now we've Docker Containers ready for push to Container Registry so that we can use them in future labs.

To publish a Docker container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR), you will need to have the following:

1. Create an Azure Container Registry. If you don't have one, you can create one by following the instructions in the Azure Portal or using Azure CLI. As part of the Chapter-2 we will create this azure resource, you can come back to this steps after ACR is created.
1. Log in to your Azure Container Registry using the Docker command-line interface. You can do this by running the following command:
```bash
# azure Login
az login

# set the azure subscription
az account set -s "anji.keesari"

# Log in to the container registry
az acr login --name acr1dev

# To get the login server address for verification
az acr list --resource-group rg-acr-dev --query "[].{acrLoginServer:loginServer}" --output table

# output should look similar to this.

# AcrLoginServer    
# ------------------
# acr1dev.azurecr.io
```
1. `Tag` your Docker container with the full name of your Azure Container Registry, including the repository name and the version tag. You can do this by running the following command:
```bash
docker tag sample/aspnet-api:20230226.1 acr1dev.azurecr.io/sample/aspnet-api:20230226.1
```
Use this command to see a list of your current local images
```bash
docker images

# output

REPOSITORY                             TAG          IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
acr1dev.azurecr.io/sample/aspnet-api   20230226.1   1bab8ba123ca   2 hours ago     213MB
```
1. Push your Docker container to your Azure Container Registry using the Docker command-line interface. You can do this by running the following command:
```bash
docker push acr1dev.azurecr.io/sample/aspnet-api:20230226.1

# output

The push refers to repository [acr1dev.azurecr.io/sample/aspnet-api]

```
5. Wait for the push to complete. Depending on the size of your Docker container and the speed of your internet connection, this may take a few minutes.
5. Verify the newly pushed image to ACR.
```bash 
# List images in registry
az acr repository list --name acr1dev --output table

# output

Result
-------------------------------
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk
sample/aspnet-api
```
6. Show the new tags of a image in the acr
```bash 
az acr repository show-tags --name acr1dev --repository sample/aspnet-api --output table

# output

Result
----------
20230220.1
20230226.1
```

You've successfully pushed your Docker container to Azure Container Registry. You can now use the Azure Portal or Azure CLI to manage your container and deploy them to Azure services like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Step-8: Pull docker container from ACR

Pull docker container from ACR is something may be helpful during container troubleshooting.

To pull a Docker container from Azure Container Registry (ACR), you need to perform the following steps:


1. Log in to your Azure Container Registry using the Docker command-line interface. You can do this by running the following command:
``` sh
# Log in to the container registry
az acr login --name acr1dev
```
1. Pull your Docker container from your Azure Container Registry using the Docker command-line interface. You can do this by running the following command:
```bash 
docker pull acr1dev.azurecr.io/sample/aspnet-api:20230226.1

# output

```
1. Wait for the pull to complete. Depending on the size of your Docker container and the speed of your internet connection, this may take a few minutes.
![image.jpg](images/image-6.jpg)
1. Verify the recently pulled container from ACR to make sure it running as expected
```bash 
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 acr1dev.azurecr.io/sample/aspnet-api:20230226.1
```
Test the container running following URL

![image.jpg](images/image-7.jpg)

<http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html>

You've successfully pulled your Docker container from Azure Container Registry. You can now use the Docker command-line interface to manage your container and run them locally or deploy them to other environments.
